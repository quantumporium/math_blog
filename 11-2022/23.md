# Number
Number are made of digit, we don't talk a lot about digit, they are like letter for words. The letter are not talk about unless there is a problem or it is
exceptionnally needed. In our decimal number system we have 10 digit (dec mean ten). And we use those 10 digit to create most number we use. If you change numerical
system you will use another kind of digit wich will cause you number to look different. For example, the binary number system has 2 digit (1, 0) to create its number.
This mean that binary number look really different to decimal number.

$$
\begin{split}
\text{ digit of different decimal number} \\
Decimal \space {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} \\
Digit \space {0, 1}
\end{split}
$$

# equation 
Number are put together into mathematical equation. Those mathematical prose, are what most of mathematica is concerned about (at least most of applied math). We solve 
them, we think about them and we manipulate them. An equation can say something about the world creating a bridge between the abstract and almost phylosophical world of
math and the concrete real world or it can stay in its abstract form.

$$
\begin{split}
\text{ example of an equation } \\
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{t}
\end{split}
